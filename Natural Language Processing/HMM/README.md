# Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sequence parsing using viterbi decoder algorithm.

Result

Start decoding.
39547 emission probabilities and 45 states in the training data.

=========================== result ===========================

Number of observations(words) = 56684.
Number of correctly predicted states = 53260.
Accuracy of this model is 53260 / 56684 = 93.959495%.
