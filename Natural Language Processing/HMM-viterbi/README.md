# Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sequence parsing <br /> using viterbi decoder algorithm.

The results are shown below.


Start decoding.<br />
39547 emission probabilities and 45 states in the training data.<br />

=========================== result ===========================<br />

Number of observations(words) = 56684.<br />
Number of correctly predicted states = 53269.<br />
Accuracy of this model is 53269 / 56684 = 93.975372%.<br />
